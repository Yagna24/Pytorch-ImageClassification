# Pytorch-ImageClassification
Ants and Bees Classification based on PyTorch 


Model trained on pretrained Inceptionv3, resnet50, squeezenet and shufflenet. 
Pretrained models ensembled (3x Incept, 3xResnet) to check imporvement. 
Ensembled weights give low accuracy, probably because of high accuracy and vanishing gradient problem.
